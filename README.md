## Notice
I try to write a pure Swift library of [YYKit](https://github.com/ibireme/YYKit), but after a few days of work, I found this excellent project - [SwifterSwift](https://github.com/SwifterSwift/swifterSwift). Should I continue? To do, or not to do, that is the question. OK, finally, I carried on this, because there are some difference between them, I combined them together, some extentions were copied directly from [SwifterSwift](https://github.com/SwifterSwift/swifterSwift) and I rewrited part of [YYKit](https://github.com/ibireme/YYKit) in Swift. In addition, I found some issues in [SwifterSwift](https://github.com/SwifterSwift/swifterSwift) and contributed to the project. During this time I also practiced a lot and improved my ability of Swift.
